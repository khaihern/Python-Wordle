# Welcome to Python Wordle's repository!

## About

A clone of the popular web-based, puzzle game Wordle originally made by Josh Wardle. This version is made using Pygame in Python for users to play on their device. Players have 6 chances to guess a 5-letter word.

### What are the new features in this version?

1. Users can download the game onto their device to play locally. No need to have an internet to enjoy at all.
2. Play Wordle as many times as your heart desire. The word changes every time you start a new game.
3. Clean design without all the extra clutter. Just the gameplay and that's it!

## How to get it?

Simply download/clone this project onto your device and run the main.py python file. 

## Can I try this game out without downloading it?

Yes, you can try it out on Replit with this [url]() in your browser. However, you would need the internet in this case and the project might not run as fast as it would locally due to Replit's limitation.

## How and why I built this app?

I built this app using Python and the Pygame module! After having been using python for a while, I wanted to see if I can apply my python skillset "visually" so I started to learn Pygame. Great thanks to [Tech with Tim YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim) for teaching me many of the basics and best practices.
